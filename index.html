					Some of you have seen a lot of casualties lately in the webhosting scene:
					hosting companies being wiped and rm'd at the expense of their clients. While
					some of this is collateral damage, we're about to show you, ladies and
					gentlemen, that sometimes you aren't pwned because of who you host but what you
					say.
						
						Practice what you preach.
